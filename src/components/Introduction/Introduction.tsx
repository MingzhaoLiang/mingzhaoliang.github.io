					Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ After spending over a year delving into the world of data
					analytics during internships, I've decided to pivot my career towards Front-end
					Development. Formerly a research assistant at The University of Melbourne, my
					work has been accepted by the MSR 2024 conference â€“ a real pinch-me moment!

					From sleek designs to seamless journeys, I thrive on creating engaging
					interfaces. Transitioning from crunching numbers to crafting code has been quite
					the journey, but it's one I'm diving into headfirst with enthusiasm and a hunger
					to learn.
